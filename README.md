# OpenWave-200

## Prerequisites

You need some Python libraries to run OpenWave-200. Most notably, these are (at least):

- matplotlib
- pyqt5
- pyside
- serial

For example, on Ubuntu, this is the command line to install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-pyqt5 python-pyside python-serial
```

## Equipment

To use this software, you need a digital storage oscilloscope like GDS-200/300 (GOOD WILL INSTRUMENT) or IDS-200/300 (RS Pro)

Also LSF files saved from these devices can be converted to readable CSV files or plotted into PNG
