# OpenWave-200

## Prerequisites

You need some Python libraries to run OpenWave-200. Most notably, these are (at least):

- matplotlib
- pyqt5
- pyside
- serial

For example, on Ubuntu, this is the command line to install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib python-pyqt5 python-pyside python-serial
```

OpenWave-200 is an open-source project. It's a simple python program that can get image or raw data from digital storage oscilloscope (GDS-200/300, IDS-200/300) via the USB port.

## Equipment

You have to get a new digital storage oscilloscope - GDS-200/300 (GOOD WILL INSTRUMENT), IDS-200/300 (RS Pro)
