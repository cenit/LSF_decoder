# LSF_decoder

`LSF_decoder` is based on `OpenWave-200` and `dso200`, both released with LGPL license by Good Will Instrument Co.

`LSF_decoder` is released with the same license as the original code.

## Prerequisites

You need matplotlib and numpy Python libraries to run `LSF_decoder`.

For example, on Ubuntu, this is the command line to install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-matplotlib python-numpy
```

While the script is written in Python 3, it should be compatible with Python 2 (but it is unsupported and may become broken anytime).

## Equipment

To produce LSF files, you need a digital storage oscilloscope like GDS-200/300 (GOOD WILL INSTRUMENT) or IDS-200/300 (RS Pro)
